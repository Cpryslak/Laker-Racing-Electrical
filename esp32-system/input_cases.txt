This is a list of input cases that need to be handled by the esp32 shifting code.

- Both paddles pulled at same time.
- Paddle is held down for several seconds.
- Paddle is pulled again before shifting is done.
    - Should the inputs be queued or ignored?
        - Ignore since the second pull is likely to be accidental.
            would also ignore some false positives from noise.
- Pulling second paddle while first is still being pulled.
- Trying to shift too high/low.

- All combonations of other conditions
